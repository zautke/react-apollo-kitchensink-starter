# react-apollo-kitchensink-starter

This boilerplate, starter, what-not was factored out from a another project, so my apologies if the 'deengineering' has left some artefacts. I am still scanning the code... :thumbsup:

A derivation off of `create-react-app`, this project includes/adds:

* React 16.2
* Redux 5.0.6
* Apollo 1.92
* Babel w/ stage-0+ ESx transpilation
* ImmutableJS
* Sass
* PostCSS
* Enzyme
* AirBnB-flavored ESLint
* Webpack3 development (w/ HMR) and production deploy settings
* Dotenv inclusion in webpack builds

I am working hard on finding the time to bump the dragging versions (React, Apollo and Webpack specifically), so stay tuned!
